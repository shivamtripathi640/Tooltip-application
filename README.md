# Tooltip Component

In this application I will create a tooltip component with react js.I will calculate the position of the element and place the tooltip based on this position, tooltip will not be inside the element but positioned relative to the body element.On hovering of the button I show a tooltip.
The component will receive the ‘position‘ of tooltip as prop.We can pass options : “top”, “bottom”, “right”, “left”.
According to the position the tooltip should render at that position.
